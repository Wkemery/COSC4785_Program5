1.
  E.G. x = new A [Expression]. must expression evaluate to an int? I think yes
2.
  what does x = new int[] actually do?
3.
  what does x = new A[5] make sense? right now I allow it... I think so
   does it call default constructor?
5.
  is x = new A; allowed? or just x = new int; 
    if x = new A[5] is allowed, then surely x = new A is allowed
5.
  are class variables private?
